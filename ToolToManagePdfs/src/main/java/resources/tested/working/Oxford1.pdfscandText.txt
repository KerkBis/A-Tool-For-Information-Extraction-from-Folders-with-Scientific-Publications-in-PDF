ABSTRACT
Upper respiratory and pulmonary diseases are the primary manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However,
kidney involvement has also been recognized and extensively described. A large percentage of affected patients present
with acute kidney injury (AKI). However, specific phenotypic aspects of AKI or other renal manifestations of COVID-19
remain sparsely characterized. Many reports indicate that proteinuria can be detected in AKI associated with COVID-19
(CoV-AKI) despite CoV-AKI being largely described as a form of acute tubular injury. On the other hand, individuals of
African ancestry with the high-risk APOL1 genotype are uniquely at risk of developing collapsing glomerulopathy when
they are infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the entity now known as COVID-19-
associated nephropathy (COVAN). Patients with COVAN typically present with nephrotic-range proteinuria. The exact
incidence of proteinuria in COVID-19 is unclear due to heterogeneity in the frequency with which proteinuria has been
assessed in cases of COVID-19, as well as methodological differences in the way proteinuria is measured and/or reported. In
this review we discuss the current evidence of proteinuria as a manifestation of COVID-19 and elaborate on potential
pathophysiological mechanisms associated with it.

INTRODUCTION
The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused
by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome co-
ronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to millions of cases and fatali-
ties worldwide, with a clinical spectrum ranging from a mild
upper respiratory tract infection to critical illness, respiratory
failure and death [1]. Kidney dysfunction is also relatively com-
mon among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and may
range from the presence of isolated proteinuria and/or hematu-
ria to full-blown acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring renal re-
placement therapy (RRT) [2]. In a systematic review and meta-
analysis of AKI in COVID-19, the prevalence of AKI across 20
cohorts was 17%, with a range of 0.5–80% [3]. Similarly, the inci-
dence of proteinuria in COVID-19 with or without concomitant
AKI has been reported in a wide range of 28–84% [4–8].
While proteinuria has been reported in the absence of AKI in
COVID-19 and may denote a subclinical insult, the widely de-
scribed observation is the presence of proteinuria in cases of
Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes–defined AKI. In or-
der to examine the existing evidence indicating that proteinuria
is a manifestation of AKI associated with COVID-19 (CoV-AKI), it
is essential to understand the mechanisms of disease leading to
AKI in COVID-19. The overwhelming majority of reports
strongly support the notion that acute tubular injury (ATI) is the
primary lesion driving CoV-AKI. The available evidence comes
from clinical cohorts with granular phenotypic characterization
and urinary sediment microscopy, premortem biopsy series and
postmortem pathological reports [4, 5, 9, 10]. As seen in other in-
fectious diseases that progress to systemic inflammatory re-
sponse syndrome, endothelial dysfunction and shock [11–15],
the majority of the CoV-AKI cases are preceded by gradual or

Key points: Risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission within households is very high. Enforcing protective 
measures at home during COVID-19 episodes, as well as supporting self-isolation within the house 
by shortening the time between symptom onset and test result, could help mitigating such risk.
